Maze
====

### Can you find the way out?

Maze is a wargame that has been rescued from the demise of
**intruded.net**, previously hosted on maze.intruded.net. **Big thanks
to adc, morla and reth** for their help in resurrecting this game!

What follows below is the original description of maze, copied from
intruded.net:

    Summary:
    Difficulty:     5/10
    Levels:         9
    Platform:   Linux/x86

    Author:
    beng and capsyl

    Special Thanks:
    je for doing the primary beta-testing.
    kuba for beta-testing and ideas.
    psi for level9

    Description:
    You'll need knowledge of exploitation-techniques, programming (of course) and reverse-
    engineering. We've tried to make the levels tricky and some of them strange, so get ready
    to use gdb.

Maze's levels are called **maze0, maze1, ... etc.** and can be accessed
on **maze.labs.overthewire.org** through SSH on port 2225.

To login to the first level use:

    Username: maze0
    Password: maze0

Data for the levels can be found in **/maze/**.
