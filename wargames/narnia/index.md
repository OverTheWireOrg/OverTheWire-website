### We all have to start somewhere.

intruded.net:

    Special Thanks:
    lx_jakal for pointing out a bug that made a level easier =)

    Description:
    This wargame is for the ones that want to learn basic exploitation. You can see the most
    common bugs in this game and we've tried to make them easy to exploit. You'll get the
    source code of each level to make it easier for you to spot the vuln and abuse it. The
    difficulty of the game is somewhere between Leviathan and Behemoth, but some of the
    levels could be quite tricky.

Narnia's levels are called **narnia0, narnia1, ... etc.** and can be
accessed on **narnia.labs.overthewire.org** through SSH on port 2226.

To login to the first level use:

    Username: narnia0
    Password: narnia0

Data for the levels can be found in **/narnia/**.
