### Are you adequate?

Utumno is a wargame that has been rescued from the demise of
**intruded.net**, previously hosted on utumno.intruded.net. **Big thanks
to adc, morla and reth** for their help in resurrecting this game!

What follows below is the original description of utumno, copied from
intruded.net:

    Summary:
    Difficulty:     4/10
    Levels:         10
    Platform:   Linux/x86

    Special Thanks:

    Description:
    This is a regular wargame composed of 10 different levels. It's slightly harder than the
    previous wargames in the same genre. Actually, it's a lot harder than Leviathan and a bit
    harder than Behemoth so if you haven't beaten those two you will probably want to do that
    first.

Utumno's levels are called **utumno0, utumno1, ... etc.** and can be
accessed on **utumno.labs.overthewire.org** through SSH on port 2227.

To login to the first level use:

    Username: utumno0
    Password: utumno0

Data for the levels can be found in **/utumno/**.
