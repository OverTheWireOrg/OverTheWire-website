Semtex
======

{% include beginNote.html title="2012-04-18 - some semtex levels verified" %}
The semtex wargame has been migrated to a new server. Because of this
move, some levels might no longer work as intended. If you run into
trouble, [contact us on IRC][].

We have verified that level 0 up to and including 5 work fine.

Wargame?
--------
This network is a legal environment where you can learn
coding/hacking techniques without destroying anything. You have to
solve Semtex 0 to get a username/password for login. Once logged in,
you have to make your way from one level to the next, each one
containing a small security hole/feature that has been installed for
you. Your mission is to find out how to exploit the weakness and to
cause interesting behavior :)

Rules?
------
Well you can do anything you want on this box, code, hack, learn,
... its all there for gaining knowledge. Please refrain from DOS
attacks of any kind, it ruins the fun of you and of others. As long
as you behave, everything is possible.

Contribute?
