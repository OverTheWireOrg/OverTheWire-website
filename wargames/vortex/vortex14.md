Bad Encryption
--------------
Based on something seen in the "real world", it has weak encryption
usage, used over a TCP/IP connection. This level requires you to
apply some logic to the challenge at hand. You must login to
[vortex.labs.overthewire.org][] to complete this level.

The \> indicates traffic "from the server, to the client", and the <
indicates traffic "from the client, to the server".

If you need some hints, consider how you can divide and conquer the
problem. For example, does it look like symmetric encryption, or
asymmetric encryption? How can you further classify them?
