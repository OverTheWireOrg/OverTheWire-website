Level Goal
----------
The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the
password of the current level to **a port on localhost in the range
31000 to 32000**. First find out which of these ports have a server
listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL and which
don't. There is only 1 server that will respond successfully and 
provide private SSH keys to use and access the next level, the
others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.

Commands you may need to solve this level
-----------------------------------------
ssh, telnet, nc, openssl, s\_client, nmap
