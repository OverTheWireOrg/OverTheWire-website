Level Goal
----------
Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easy...
The shell for user bandit26 is not **/bin/bash**, but something else.
Find out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it.

Commands you may need to solve this level
-----------------------------------------
ssh, cat, more, vi, ls, id, pwd
