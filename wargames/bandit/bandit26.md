Level Goal
----------
Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easy...
The shell for user bandit26 is not **/bin/bash**, but something else.
Find out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it.

> NOTE: if you're a Windows user and typically use Powershell to
> `ssh` into bandit: Powershell is known to cause issues with the
> intended solution to this level. You should use command prompt
> instead.

Commands you may need to solve this level
