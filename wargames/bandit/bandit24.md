Level Goal
----------
A program is running automatically at regular intervals from
**cron**, the time-based job scheduler. Look in **/etc/cron.d/** for
the configuration and see what command is being executed.

 **NOTE:** This level requires you to create your own first
shell-script. This is a very big step and you should be proud of
yourself when you beat this level!

 **NOTE 2:** Keep in mind that your shell script is removed once
executed, so you may want to keep a copy around...

Commands you may need to solve this level
-----------------------------------------
chmod, cron, crontab, crontab(5) (use "man 5 crontab" to access this)
