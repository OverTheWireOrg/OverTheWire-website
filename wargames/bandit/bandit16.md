The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the
password of the current level to **port 30001 on localhost** using
SSL encryption.

 **Helpful note: Getting "HEARTBEATING" and "Read R BLOCK"? Use

Next to 'R' and 'Q', the 'B' command also works in this version of
that command...**
