Level Goal
----------
The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt**,
which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed.
For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in
which you can work using mkdir. For example: mkdir /tmp/myname123.
Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the
manpages!)

Commands you may need to solve this level
-----------------------------------------
grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd, mkdir,
cp, mv, file
