Level Info
----------
Substitution ciphers are a simple replacement algorithm. In this
example of a substitution cipher, we will explore a 'monoalphebetic'
cipher. Monoalphebetic means, literally, "one alphabet" and you will
see why.

This level contains an old form of cipher called a 'Caesar Cipher'.
A Caesar cipher shifts the alphabet by a set number. For example:

    plain:  a b c d e f g h i j k ... 
    cipher: G H I J K L M N O P Q ...

In this example, the letter 'a' in plaintext is replaced by a 'G' in
the ciphertext so, for example, the plaintext 'bad' becomes 'HGJ' in
ciphertext.

The password for level 3 is in the file krypton3. It is in 5 letter
group ciphertext. It is encrypted with a Caesar Cipher. Without any
further information, this cipher text may be difficult to break. You
do not have direct access to the key, however you do have access to
a program that will encrypt anything you wish to give it using the
key. If you think logically, this is completely easy.

One shot can solve it!

Have fun.
