Level Info
----------
The password for level 2 is in the file 'krypton2'. It is
'encrypted' using a simple rotation. It is also in non-standard
ciphertext format. When using alpha characters for cipher text it is
normal to group the letters into 5 letter clusters, regardless of
word boundaries. This helps obfuscate any patterns. This file has
kept the plain text word boundaries and carried them to the cipher
text. Enjoy!
