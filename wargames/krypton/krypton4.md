Good job!

You more than likely used some form of FA and some common sense to
solve that one.

So far we have worked with simple substitution ciphers. They have
also been 'monoalphabetic', meaning using a fixed key, and giving a
one to one mapping of plaintext (P) to ciphertext (C). Another type
of substitution cipher is referred to as 'polyalphabetic', where one
character of P may map to many, or all, possible ciphertext
characters.

An example of a polyalphabetic cipher is called a Vigenère Cipher. It
works like this:

If we use the key(K) 'GOLD', and P = PROCEED MEETING AS AGREED, then
"add" P to K, we get C. When adding, if we exceed 25, then we roll
to 0 (modulo 26).

    P P R O C E E D M E E T I N G A S A G R E E D\
    K G O L D G O L D G O L D G O L D G O L D G O\

becomes:

    P 15 17 14 2 4 4 3 12 4 4 19 8 13 6 0 18 0 6 17 4 4 3\
    K 6 14 11 3 6 14 11 3 6 14 11 3 6 14 11 3 6 14 11 3 6 14\
    C 21 5 25 5 10 18 14 15 10 18 4 11 19 20 11 21 6 20 2 8 10 17\

So, we get a ciphertext of:

    VFZFK SOPKS ELTUL VGUCH KR

This level is a Vigenère Cipher. You have intercepted two longer,
english language messages (American English). You also have a key piece of information.
You know the key length!

For this exercise, the key length is 6. The password to level five
is in the usual place, encrypted with the 6 letter key.

Have fun!
