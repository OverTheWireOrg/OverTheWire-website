thanks to adc, morla and reth** for their help in resurrecting this
game!

What follows below is the original description of behemoth, copied from
intruded.net:

    Special Thanks:

    Description:
    This wargame deals with a lot of regular vulnerabilities found commonly 'out 
    in the wild'. While the game makes no attempts at emulating a real environment
    it will teach you how to exploit several of the most common coding mistakes 
    including buffer overflows, race conditions and privilege escalation.

Behemoth's levels are called **behemoth0, behemoth1, ... etc.** and can
be accessed on **behemoth.labs.overthewire.org** through SSH on port 2221.

To login to the first level use:

    Username: behemoth0
    Passowrd: behemoth0

Data for the levels can be found in **/behemoth/**.
